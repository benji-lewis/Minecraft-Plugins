# Kim Jong Un 3 (Nova Addon)

Kim Jong Un 3 is a Nova addon for PaperMC that spawns a themed mob which drops randomized missile or launchpad parts. Players can assemble the parts into a launchpad and missile, then target an ICBM strike via an in-game GUI. The blast produces a mushroom cloud, lingering fallout, and can be mitigated with a radiation suit. Items are registered as Nova items so they integrate with Nova's resource pack pipeline.
