# Kim Jong Un — Player Guide

## How it works
- A special Kim Jong Un mob can spawn randomly in the world.
- When defeated, it drops **one random part** (missile part or launchpad part).
- It can also drop an **ICBM Core** for crafting strategic missiles.
- Collect the parts to craft an **Assembled Missile** and **Assembled Launchpad**.

## Crafting the Parts
Use any crafting grid (shapeless):
- **Assembled Missile** = missile nose + missile body + missile engine
- **Assembled Launchpad** = launchpad base + launchpad control + launchpad support
- **Assembled ICBM** = assembled missile + ICBM core

## Launching a Missile
1. Hold the **Assembled Launchpad** and right-click a block to place it.
2. Hold the **Assembled Missile** and right-click the launchpad to trigger the standard thermonuclear launch.

## Launching an ICBM
1. Hold the **Assembled Launchpad** and right-click a block to place it.
2. Hold the **Assembled ICBM** and right-click the launchpad.
3. Use the **ICBM Targeting** GUI to set X/Y/Z coordinates:
   - Left click to add +1, right click to subtract -1, and shift-click for +/-10.
   - Click **Use Current Location** to auto-fill your current coordinates.
4. Click **Launch ICBM** to send it to the target.
5. Enjoy the dramatic launch sequence, mushroom cloud, and fallout.

## Radiation Suit
Craft a full radiation suit to protect yourself from fallout.
Use glowstone dust with leather armor pieces in the crafting grid to make:
- **Radiation Suit Helmet**
- **Radiation Suit Chestplate**
- **Radiation Suit Leggings**
- **Radiation Suit Boots**

## Tips
- Launchpads and missiles use custom-model item visuals from the plugin resource pack.
- You need the `kimjongun.use` permission to place and launch.
