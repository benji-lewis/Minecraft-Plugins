# Kim Jong Un 2 (Paper Plugin)

Kim Jong Un 2 is a PaperMC plugin that spawns a themed mob which drops randomized missile or launchpad parts. Players can assemble the parts into a launchpad and missile, then trigger a dramatic missile launch using custom 3D resource-pack models. Texture PNGs are intentionally omitted from the repo; supply your own textures for the referenced model files.
